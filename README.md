Regression Discontinuity Tree

This repository extends Athey-Imbens (2016) causal trees to regression discontinuity designs.

## Content
This repository contains codes and description how to estimate heterogeneous treatment effect in RDD. Codes are built in MatLab, version 2016b.
If you want to use the codes, you need to add the **codes** folder to your path in MatLab.

**tryout.m** gives an example how to use the package.

**Reguly_CATE_RD.pdf** is the current working paper on this topic.
